Architecture
  - Master Node:
      - Container Runtime
      - etcd:
          - db, sotre data in key value
          - store all worker and master node data/information
      - kube-scheduler:
          - distribute load across worker node
          - schedule the node accordingly to the node
      - kube-apiserver:
          - Front end of the cluster
          - expose all k8s api
          - manages 
      - kube-controller manager: check if anything goes down and bring them up
        - Node Controller: if nodes goes down
        - Replication: maintains required no of replicas of a pod
        - Endpoint: populates the end point
         - Servicd Account and Token Controller: create default account and api access for new namspace 
        - Cloud Control: responsible for cloud specific tasks
        - Route Controller: for setting up the routes
        - Service controller: for creating/updating/deleting cloud lb
  - Worker Node:
      - Container Runtime: like docker 
      - kubelet: 
        - agent runs on worker node
        - 
      - kube-proxy:
        - network proxy
        - maintains network rules
        - helps in intra - inter pod communication
  - Azure CNI:
