# Resource Request and Limits

## What it is?

- K8s defines **Limits** as the **maximum** amount of a resource to be used by a container. This means that the container can never consume more than the memory amount or CPU amount indicated.
- **Requests**, on the other hand, are the **minimum** guaranteed amount of a resource that is reserved for a container.
